A simple WebSite for your photos.

Tripode is a very simple php website builder where you can upload your photos. The idea behind is having the simplest site possible and reduce the configuration to minimum (of course this results in a little customizable site but easy to use and install). It is good for very small image galleries that you want to create with free hosting and spending very little time.

Photos are divided into categories and may have a very short description. A category can have a bigger description using html. The home page is as well customizable.

Images can be uploaded within categories. They are resized with a width of 1200 pixels (a thumb as well is created)
